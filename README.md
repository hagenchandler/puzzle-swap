(could figure out how to crawl this website to create database of puzzles)

12/3: Initial thoughts for this app would be to have a UI similar to a 
      craigslist or zillow where puzzles are suggested based on location.
      The main idea is to allow people to lend out and borrow puzzles. 
      It is mostly an exercise for system designs and practicing the 
      technologies that I want to gain experience with.

12/5: Created the initial React project and am currently thinking about
      the best way to keep track of the puzzles. Look into ways to keep 
      track of who has what. Possibly follow a zero trust style system.
      I should start drawing UI mockups possibly to design the app. Think
      about how I want to do that and look into tools as well as get 
      started on designing the PostgreSQL database. I also don't know as 
      much as I'd like to about Docker so start learning about 
      containerization through Docker.

12/11: Trimmed the React Project down. I think I will do the UI first and
       design it with the CRUD operations in mind. Previously I have mostly
       done backend work so I hope that I will learn frontend better and
       have the motivation to finish the project with something familiar
       rather than the other way around.
