12/3: Initial thoughts for this app would be to have a UI similar to a 
      craigslist or zillow where puzzles are suggested based on location.
      The main idea is to allow people to lend out and borrow puzzles. 
      It is mostly an exercise for system designs and practicing the 
      technologies that I want to gain experience with.
